<h1>The History of the Latino Community in San Fernando Valley</h1>   
<div id="Introduction">
    <h2>About the Latinx Community</h2>
    <p> The Latino/x community is comprised of people who come from Latinx American descent or ancestry. Some common languages spoken among Latinos include Spanish and Portuguese.</p>
    <h3>Why am I starting this site?</h3>
    <p> When we examine the history of Latinos within Los Angeles, there tends to be a focus on the central part of Los Angeles, such as Downtown LA. There isn't much reference to the San Fernando, which historically has had a large Latino population dating back to the 1950s/60s. In other words, I want to learn more about the history of the region and the impact of Latinos in the area and across Los Angeles.</p>
